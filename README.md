Crypto Dashboard

This workspace includes a Streamlit dashboard that reads `cryptocurrency_prices.csv` (generated by the notebook scraper) and displays:

- Top-10 snapshot table and charts
- Market cap bar chart (log scale)
- Per-coin historical price chart (if multiple timestamps exist)

Run the dashboard locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

Notes:
- Ensure `cryptocurrency_prices.csv` is present in the same directory before launching.
- The dashboard uses the latest `Timestamp` snapshot in the CSV to show the current Top-10.
